# Dependency and unsafe policy

Every direct dependency is a review obligation over its **entire transitive tree**. One malicious crate anywhere in the graph compromises the whole application — and it does not need to wait until runtime, because `build.rs` and proc macros execute on the build host.

## Before adding a crate

1. Does `std` do it? Does an already-present dependency do it? Is it under ~100 lines to write?
2. Cost of admission — run before `cargo add`, not after:

```
cargo tree --depth 1                        # what you already have
cargo tree --invert <crate> --workspace     # who else pulls it in, and at which versions
cargo tree -e build                         # build scripts and proc macros: arbitrary code at build time
```

`--invert` needs a package spec, and without `--workspace` it answers only for the current member.

3. Verify the exact name and repo URL. Typo-squats differ by one character.
4. Check for `unsafe`. A crate advertising `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` is a weak signal, not an admission criterion — see below.

A dependency that adds 40 transitive crates to save 30 lines is a bad trade.

## The four questions a dependency gate must answer

Graph shape and advisories are two of them. A high-assurance gate answers all four:

| Question | Tool |
| --- | --- |
| Is this graph shaped acceptably — licenses, duplicates, sources? | `cargo deny` |
| Has anyone published a vulnerability against it? | `cargo audit` |
| **Has the code itself been reviewed, by someone, at a stated criterion?** | `cargo vet` |
| **Does the artifact Cargo downloaded match the source that was reviewed?** | artifact/source reconciliation |

`cargo deny` and `cargo audit` answer nothing about the third and fourth. They are policy and advisory checks, not review.

## cargo-vet: admission control

`cargo vet` maps the resolved dependency graph onto audit records — yours, or ones you explicitly import from an organization you trust — and fails when a version enters the graph with no audit covering it.

```
cargo install --locked --version <pinned> cargo-vet
cargo vet init
cargo vet --locked
```

- Commit `supply-chain/` — the policy, your audits, and the imports — alongside `Cargo.lock`.
- Require **`safe-to-deploy`** for anything in a production subtree; it covers generated and deployed code and implies `safe-to-run`.
- Define a custom criterion (`crypto-reviewed`, `parses-untrusted-input`) for crypto, TLS, and any parser fed by a peer, and require it there.
- `cargo vet init` writes an exemption for everything already present. That set is **not evidence**. Shrink it deliberately, put an expiry on every entry, and require a security owner's approval to add one.
- A delta audit between two versions is usually the affordable unit; reserve full audits for what deserves them.

`cargo-crev` is a useful second signal — cryptographically signed reviews and an explicit web of trust, still actively published — but its assurance is exactly the assurance of the identities you trusted. Import only named, approved reviewers, set a trust depth, and rank it behind your own vet policy.

## Build scripts and proc macros are privileged code

Cargo runs a package's `build.rs` **before** building that package, with your user's privileges: it can read `~/.ssh`, reach the network, and shell out. A proc macro runs inside `rustc` with the same reach. Reviewing the graph does not contain either.

- Run dependency-introduction and release builds in a disposable, least-privilege environment. Deny network egress by default.
- On Linux, `cackle` (`cargo acl`) plus `bubblewrap` enforces per-package API and filesystem permissions, including sandboxing `rustc` so proc macros are contained. Commit `cackle.toml` with a narrowly reviewed permission entry for every build script, and run it in CI.
- Treat it as defence in depth: Cackle's own docs describe evasion routes and non-granular proc-macro permissions.
- `cargo tree -e build` is the inventory. A new entry there is a security review, not a version bump.

The same applies to the build scripts **you** write, and there the rules are about correctness as much as trust:

- No network, no secrets, no time- or environment-dependent generation. A build that is not reproducible is a build whose artifact corresponds to no commit.
- Write only into `OUT_DIR`, and never assume it is clean — it persists between builds.
- Declare every input: `cargo::rerun-if-changed=` for each file read, `cargo::rerun-if-env-changed=` for each variable. An undeclared input is a stale artifact waiting to happen.
- Read `CARGO_CFG_TARGET_OS`, `CARGO_CFG_TARGET_ARCH`, `CARGO_CFG_TARGET_HAS_ATOMIC` — never host `cfg!`, which describes the machine running the script (`har-target`).
- Validate generated source before `include!`ing it, and keep generation deterministic so two builds of one commit produce identical bytes.
- A proc macro has the compiler's file and stdio access and can hang a build. Pin and audit them, bound the input complexity they accept, and test the expansion (`cargo expand`).

## Verify the artifact, not just the repository

The `.crate` file Cargo downloads is not provably the repository you read. For new and updated dependencies that carry build scripts, proc macros, native code, or shipped binaries, reconcile the published artifact against its source: `cargo-witness` compares the downloaded crate to an attested commit where crates.io Trusted Publishing exists, and to package VCS metadata otherwise, flagging injected or modified `build.rs` and unexpected binaries. An unverifiable result means **manual review required**, not pass.

Prefer versions published through Trusted Publishing, and publish your own crates that way — OIDC rather than a long-lived token — but treat provenance as a signal about *who published*, never as a code audit.

Identify a publisher from the **crates.io owners**, not from `repository` and never from `authors`. The `repository` field says where source lives; it is not the set of accounts authorized to publish or yank, that set can be users or teams, and it changes over time. `cargo supply-chain publishers` reports it. For crates you own, use team ownership.

## Unsafe posture

Workspace root:

```toml
[workspace.lints.rust]
unsafe_code = "forbid"
```

and in **every** member's manifest:

```toml
[lints]
workspace = true
```

Workspace lints are not implicitly inherited — Cargo warns when a member omits the opt-in, so CI-check for it. `forbid` beats `deny`: it cannot be re-enabled by an inner `#[allow]` during a later refactor.

This binds your crates only, never dependencies; Cargo caps lints for non-path dependencies. Roughly a fifth of public crates use `unsafe`, and unsound `unsafe` produces exactly the memory errors Rust otherwise eliminates. To see it:

```
cargo install --locked --version <pinned> cargo-geiger
cargo geiger                      # unsafe counts per crate in the graph
cargo tree -f "{p} {f}"           # feature flags that may enable unsafe paths
```

`cargo-geiger` is maintained and is a **triage metric, not a verdict** — its own docs say so. It counts explicit `unsafe` and can say nothing about safe-looking code, build scripts, proc macros, generated or native code, or a malicious upstream change. Diff the counts and locations across an upgrade and review what moved. Neither a zero count nor a `forbid(unsafe_code)` badge is an admission criterion; `cargo vet` and the sandbox are.

Vet reachable unsafe first — `unsafe` in a code path you never call is lower risk than `unsafe` under your hot loop. Safe abstractions over `unsafe` internals are legitimate; unchecked `unsafe` in your own call graph is not.

**When `unsafe` is unavoidable.** Confine it to one module that does exactly one thing, never wider. Keep that module out from under the workspace `forbid` with a local `deny` rather than weakening the workspace setting. `SAFETY:` on both sides — the block and every caller — naming which side owns which precondition. Review the whole module, not the diff, with two reviewers. Test the unsafe code *and* its clients, plus one test across the boundary. Keep an inventory of every `unsafe` site with its evaluated risk:

```toml
# unsafe-inventory.toml — one entry per site, reviewed at the version named
[[site]]
module   = "crates/ring_buffer/src/raw.rs"
kind     = "UnsafeCell + unsafe impl Sync"
risk     = "high"
reviewed = { by = ["alice", "bob"], commit = "9e3a29d", date = "2026-08-14" }
tests    = ["loom::ring", "miri::ring_roundtrip"]
```

An unlisted `unsafe` is an unreviewed one. `har-unsafe` covers how to read one.

## cargo-deny

One tool, four gates. `deny.toml` at the workspace root:

```toml
[advisories]
yanked = "deny"
unmaintained = "all"              # "workspace" checks direct deps only
unsound = "all"                   # default scopes this to workspace deps too
unused-ignored-advisory = "deny"  # a stale ignore is a silent hole

[bans]
multiple-versions = "deny"
wildcards = "deny"

[licenses]
allow = ["MIT", "Apache-2.0", "BSD-3-Clause", "Unicode-3.0"]

[sources]
unknown-registry = "deny"
unknown-git = "deny"
required-git-spec = "rev"         # an allowed git source must still pin a revision
allow-git = ["https://github.com/example-org/example-dep"]
```

```
cargo install --locked --version <pinned> cargo-deny
cargo deny check
```

`multiple-versions = "deny"` is the highest-value line: duplicate versions mean bloat, divergent behavior between call sites, and two copies to patch when an advisory lands. Grant exceptions by name in `[bans].skip`, with the reason in the commit message, never by weakening the rule:

```toml
[[bans.skip]]
name = "windows-sys"
version = "=0.52.0"
# pulled by `notify` 6.x; drops out when notify 7 lands. Re-check 2026-12.
```

Every `[advisories].ignore` entry carries an expiry and a triage note; `unused-ignored-advisory = "deny"` is what stops them accumulating. In an offline or air-gapped lane, set a short maximum advisory-database staleness rather than letting a cached database age silently.

## cargo-audit

```
cargo install --locked --version <pinned> cargo-audit
cargo audit
```

Scans `Cargo.lock` against the RustSec advisory database. Also flags unmaintained crates. No reachability analysis, so a hit may be unexploitable in your usage — triage each one and record the verdict; do not blanket-ignore. Run in CI on every PR, plus on a schedule, since new advisories land against unchanged code.

## Pin the security tools too

A bare `cargo install cargo-deny` resolves whatever release exists that day, so the meaning of your gate changes between CI runs. `--locked` only honours *that release's* lockfile. Install every decision-making subcommand — `cargo-deny`, `cargo-vet`, `cargo-audit`, `cargo-acl`, `cargo-geiger`, `cargo-auditable`, `cargo-semver-checks`, the SBOM tool — at an approved exact version with `cargo install --locked --version …`, or from a verified prebuilt artifact, and upgrade them through the same reviewed process as dependencies.

## Toolchain, MSRV, and resolution

- Pin the toolchain in `rust-toolchain.toml` — same compiler, same lints, same output for everyone. A toolchain bump is its own commit, with its own full suite run.
- Declare `[package] rust-version` and test that exact floor in CI (`har-api` owns the MSRV contract and what raising it means for semver). Resolver 3, the edition-2024 default, prefers MSRV-compatible dependency versions; it does not test the floor for you.
- Assert `RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP` is unset in CI. It turns a stable toolchain into a nightly one silently, and every guarantee you documented was about the stable one. This is also why an unstable resolver or SBOM feature gets its **own pinned nightly lane**, never a bootstrap escape in the production one.
- **Release-age quarantine.** A lockfile freezes a compromised release exactly as well as a good one, so a same-day typo-squat or account takeover can be pinned in before anyone reports it. Cargo's experimental `-Z min-publish-age` / `registry.global-min-publish-age` filters versions younger than a configured window. Evaluate it in a separately pinned nightly dependency-update job, with security-reviewed exceptions, until it stabilizes.
- Choose the resolver explicitly at the workspace root. Edition 2024 implies resolver 3 (1.84+), whose `resolver.incompatible-rust-versions = "fallback"` is a *preference* for MSRV-compatible versions — a dependency's own requirements can still force a newer release. Resolve and update with the MSRV toolchain in CI so that is visible.

### Edition migration is a semantic review

`cargo fix --edition` is the mechanical half. Run the compatibility lint group, then **read** every rewrite it made, because edition 2024 changed behaviour in four places that are exactly where a high-assurance codebase lives:

| Change | What to re-examine |
| --- | --- |
| `if let` scrutinee and tail-expression **temporary drop scopes** | every lock, guard, and `Drop`-bearing temporary — the unlock point moved (`har-concurrent`) |
| `static mut` references now **denied** | every global; the fix is an atomic, a `OnceLock`, or `&raw mut` plus a real synchronization story (`har-unsafe`) |
| `extern` blocks must be `unsafe extern` | every declared foreign signature, re-validated by a human — the edition did not check them, it only made you write the word |
| `gen` is a reserved keyword | identifiers, macro output |

Add regression tests around locks, destructors and FFI before the migration, not after. Mechanical edition edits are not semantics-preserving in code that has any of the above, and the compiler will not tell you which rewrite changed a release point. Migrate on its own commit, with its own full suite run.

## Reproducible builds

- Commit `Cargo.lock`. Always for binaries; for libraries too once you ship an executable from the workspace.
- Pin git dependencies to a full commit SHA. `rev = "9e3a29d..."` is reproducible; a bare `branch` or bare `git =` silently moves under you and defeats the lockfile's intent for that crate.
- CI builds with `--locked` (and `--offline` where vendored) so a build can never silently resolve a new version.
- `cargo update` is a deliberate act: update, run the full suite, `cargo deny check`, `cargo vet`, commit the lockfile change on its own.
- `cargo vendor` when the build must survive a registry outage or run air-gapped.
- Delete prior artifacts before the build you ship. `Cargo.lock` pins inputs; it does not evict a stale `.rlib`.
- Never edit sources while a release build runs — the artifact then corresponds to no commit.

## What ships: inventory and SBOM

`Cargo.lock` describes the build input. After a RustSec advisory lands, operations needs to know which *deployed binary* contains the affected crate.

```toml
# release profile, via the cargo-auditable subcommand
```

```
cargo install --locked --version <pinned> cargo-auditable
cargo auditable build --release --locked
cargo audit bin target/release/app
```

`cargo-auditable` embeds the dependency list in the binary at negligible cost. Its own documentation says it does **not** protect against supply-chain attacks — it is an inventory, so that a disclosure becomes a query instead of an archaeology project.

Release provenance is the whole set: locked source revision, compiler and tool versions, artifact hash, the embedded inventory, and a signed SPDX or CycloneDX SBOM. Cargo's native `-Z sbom` output is an unstable JSON precursor — pin a nightly lane if you use it.

## Your qualified subset

Name the APIs this project has decided not to use, in `clippy.toml` at the workspace root:

```toml
disallowed-methods = [
    { path = "std::env::set_var", reason = "process-global, unsound alongside threads" },
]
disallowed-types = [
    { path = "std::sync::RwLock", reason = "OS-dependent fairness; Mutex unless reads dominate and contention is measured" },
]
```

Every `#[allow(...)]` carries its justification in the same commit — a deviation should cost a sentence, not nothing. `-D warnings` is never lowered to `-W` or `-A` to get a build green; severity only goes up.

## Release build

```toml
[profile.release]
lto = true
codegen-units = 1
strip = true
overflow-checks = true
```

`strip` removes symbols from what you distribute. `overflow-checks` keeps arithmetic bugs loud in production instead of silently wrapping. `har-hot-path` owns the runtime trade behind each knob.

Static linking (`x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`) gives a copy-and-run binary and takes on the patching burden — no system package manager will update a vendored dependency for you. Verify with `ldd`.

## Review checklist for a dependency PR

- `cargo vet` clean at the required criterion, with no new exemption that lacks an owner and an expiry
- New transitive crate count, and which of them run `build.rs` or proc macros — each with a reviewed `cackle.toml` entry
- Artifact reconciled against source for anything with a build script, native code, or a shipped binary
- `cargo deny check` and `cargo audit` clean; no new duplicate versions; license in the allowlist
- Changed `cargo geiger` counts reviewed by location, not by total
- Any new `unsafe` in the graph, whether it is reachable, and an inventory entry if it is yours
- Lockfile change committed on its own; MSRV still satisfied
